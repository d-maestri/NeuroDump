Topic: feature_selection
==================================================

• Gini impurity also similar but faster? less bias? not 100% sure.
• low λ = overfit.
• prof wrote this on board: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso model = Lasso(alpha=0.1) model.fit(X_train, y_train)
• ratio param controls mix. good when multicollinearity or many small coeffs.
