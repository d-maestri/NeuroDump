Topic: unsupervised_learning
==================================================

• kmeans = simplest one but still used a lot.
• alt metric = silhouette score — between -1 and 1. close to 1 = well-clustered.
• clustering ≠ classification. labels are not known. use cases: market segmentation, gene expr clustering, anomaly detection (esp dbscan). DBSCAN better for weird shapes, dense clusters — uses eps + min_samples. tricky to tune tho. forms clusters based on density, noisy pts marked as outliers (label -1).
• sklearn DBSCAN ex: from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN model = DBSCAN(eps=0.5, min_samples=5) model.fit(X)
• open Q: how to know if clusters mean anything in real world? scaling is essential — StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler from sklearn.
• pipeline ex:
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KMeans(n_clusters=3)) pipe.fit(X)
