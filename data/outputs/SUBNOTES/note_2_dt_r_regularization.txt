Topic: regularization
==================================================

• sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3) — yeah that’s what prof used.
• note: good to visualize trees but not for high dim data. lots of axis-aligned splits, hard to interpret when too many features.
• oh and trees are unstable — small data change = big model change.
