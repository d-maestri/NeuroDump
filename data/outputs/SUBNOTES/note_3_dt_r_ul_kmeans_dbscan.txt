Topic: kmeans_dbscan
==================================================

• k-means = most used.
• init centers, assign pts, recalc, repeat. problem: sensitive to init. use k-means++. elbow method not always clear. silhouette score better maybe. PCA + k-means often combined for vis. t-SNE only for viz — not for modeling. clusters in t-SNE are sometimes fake.
