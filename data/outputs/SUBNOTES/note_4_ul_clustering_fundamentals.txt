Topic: clustering_fundamentals
==================================================

• dendrogram = tree of merges.
• can "cut" tree at diff levels = diff num clusters.
• if data has diff density or shapes → fails.
• linkage: single, complete, avg. sklearn has AgglomerativeClustering.
• clustering algos rely on distance metric — Euclidean default. alt: cosine sim (for text), manhattan, etc. eval: hard bcz no true label. silhouette best for most. DB index too. compare within/between cluster distance.
• problem: result depends on init + scale. always standardize first.
